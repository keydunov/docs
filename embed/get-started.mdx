Cube D3 supports embedding the AI-powered chat interface directly into your applications via an iframe or API. This allows you to give users a guided, semantic-layer-aware data assistant—anywhere in your product or portal.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Embedding is currently behind a feature flag. Please contact [support@cube.dev](mailto:support@cube.dev) to enable it for your workspace.

---

## **Getting Started with Embedding**

### **1. Enable Embedding**

To enable the embedding feature:

- You must have **admin privileges** in your Cube instance.
- Navigate to **Admin → Embed**.
- Click **Enable Embedding**.

Once enabled, you'll see a **secret key** that can be used to sign authentication tokens. You can also regenerate this secret at any time from the same page.

---

### **2. Authenticate with a Cube JWT**

To use the embedded chat, you must generate a signed **Cube JWT** token using the secret from the Admin panel. This token must include:

- `externalTenantId` – your app’s tenant or organization ID.
- `userAttributes` – key-value pairs used for row-level security or personalization.

You can use our helper library `@cube/d3` to simplify token generation.

#### **Example (TypeScript)**

```ts
import { generateCubeJWT } from '@cube/d3';

const token = generateCubeJWT({
  secret: 'your-embed-secret',
  externalTenantId: 'org_123',
  userAttributes: {
    role: 'viewer',
    region: 'us-west',
    email: 'user@example.com'
  },
  expiresIn: '1h'
});

// Pass this token to the iframe or API call
```

---

### **3. Embedding via iframe**

To embed the chat UI in your app, include an iframe pointing to your Cube instance, passing the Cube JWT token:

```html
<iframe
  src="https://your-cube-instance.cubecloud.dev/embed/chat?token=YOUR_CUBE_JWT"
></iframe>
```

---

### **4. Using the Chat API (Optional)**

Advanced users can interact directly with Cube D3 Chat via API for custom chat UI implementations. Documentation and SDK coming soon.
