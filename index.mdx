## **What is Cube D3?**

Cube D3 is the agentic analytics runtime for Cube’s semantic layer. It enables AI agents and users to query, understand, and manipulate data models programmatically—turning the semantic layer into a dynamic workspace for generating charts, running analyses, and building data products.

With D3, you can power copilots, automate data workflows, and create interactive analytics experiences—all grounded in a consistent and governed data model.

## **Getting Started Resources**

Here’s a few resources to help you get started:

* Connect D3 to your Cube semantic layer and explore the graph-based API for querying metrics, dimensions, joins, and filters.
* Build your first agent-powered workflow or LLM integration using the D3 runtime.
* Have questions? Reach out to us at [support@cube.dev](mailto:support@cube.dev) anytime!
