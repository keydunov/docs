---

Cube D3 implements a role-based access control system with three main user roles: Admin, Developer, and User. Each role has specific permissions and access levels designed to support different responsibilities within the platform.

## Deployment Structure

- Database connections are managed through Semantic Model Deployments
- Multiple Semantic Model Deployments can exist under one account
- Roles can be either global (across all deployments) or deployment-specific
- Admin role is always global

## Role Permissions

### Admin Role

- Has highest level of privileges
- Can manage semantic models
- Can manage other users
- Has access to admin section
- Full query capabilities

### Developer Role

- Can create and edit semantic models
- Can execute SQL queries against data sources
- Can create and edit workbooks
- Can create and edit data apps
- No access to admin settings

### User Role

- Can query semantic models
- Can create and edit workbooks
- Can create and edit data apps
- Can execute Semantic SQL queries
- Cannot make changes to semantic models
- Cannot query source data directly

## Future Implementation

A Viewer role is planned for future implementation with the following capabilities:

- Use Analytics Chat with ability to query Semantic Views and existing reports
- View (read-only) access to shared data apps

## Agent Permissions

Agents are connected to Semantic Model Deployments and inherit the permission level of the user they are operating under.

## Typical Usage Scenarios

- Users: Typically data consumers and analysts
- Developers: Usually data stewards and data engineers
- Admin: Typically assigned to data engineers managing the entire Cube D3 instance
